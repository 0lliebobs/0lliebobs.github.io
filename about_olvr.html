		<h3><u><i>Why the name?</u></i></h3>
		<p>I chose OLVR Studios as a name because I thought is sounds easy to remember. OL comes from Ollie, and VR is because my first Unity game is a VR game.</p>
		<h3><u><i>What do you do?</u></i></h3>
		<p>I make games, mainly in Unity, because of the VR support. I am learning C# and web development (as you can tell) and i am working on 2 games right now.</p>
		<h3><u><i>Why do you make games?</u></i></h3>
		<p>I saw a lot of VR games, specifically Gorilla Tag fan games and thought that they all looked cool, why shouldn't I give it a go? I had already been making games on Scratch for ages now, and loved doing it.</p>
